# Task Charter — WP54: `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS` verification + ledger

**Charter Status:** `SPEC_COMPLETE`
**WP:** WP54
**Phase:** P5 (PHASE T3 group)
**task_mode:** `standard`
**Depends on:** WP7, WP39, WP52, WP53
**W4 Test Targets:** `0`

> **Metadata block** — Worker 3 Core reads only these fields to determine execution order and routing. Worker 4 checks `W4 Test Targets` before deciding whether to read section 7b. Full charter content is loaded by sub-agents in their own context windows.

---

## 1. Task Objective

- **Outcome:** the trigger table is measured rather than inferred, and the P5 gate has one auditable evidence artefact.
- **BUILD_SPEC reference:** `workflowArtifacts/canvas-v2/BUILD_SPEC_CanvasV2.md` — section 5, **PHASE T3**, component **C54 — `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS` empirical verification and verdict ledger** (work package WP54); phase **P5**.

---

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

- **In scope:**
  - Change type: create (`workflowArtifacts/canvas-v2/CaptureTriggerLedger.md`, the verification run) + modify (`plugin/src/canvas/canvas-model-bridge.ts` — `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS` `:88–93` and its assumption warning)
  - Responsibility: execute the trigger verification CONCEPT_V2 Teil 14 demands and record a per-trigger verdict WP40 can be gated on.
  - Scope summary: per-trigger verdict ledger; corrected mapping if measured
- **Out of scope / non-goals:**
  - Flipping `useCanvasBinding` — that is WP40 and only WP40.
  - Recording a verdict for an interaction whose gesture did not demonstrably take effect; that is UNCONFIRMED, not a pass.
  - Extending the adapter's patched signal set as part of this WP — if the measurement shows an interaction fires neither signal, that is a recorded finding and an ESCALATE, not silent new scope.
- **Known interfaces / dependencies:**
  - Input: the C52 tap stream and the C53 gestures against two real instances
  - Output: a per-interaction verdict ledger and, where the measurement disagrees with the assumption, a corrected `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS`
  - Depends on work packages: WP7, WP39, WP52, WP53

## 3. Architecture Context

*Task-local architecture guidance only.*

- **Component(s) being changed:** `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS` empirical verification and verdict ledger
- **Interfaces involved:**
  - Input: the C52 tap stream and the C53 gestures against two real instances
  - Output: a per-interaction verdict ledger and, where the measurement disagrees with the assumption, a corrected `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS`
- **Why PHASE T3 exists (one paragraph, do not re-derive):** CONCEPT_V2 Teil 14 makes a green two-vault run against **real Obsidian** a release condition from P0 onward, and from P5 additionally the empirical confirmation of every `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS` assumption. The rig that exists, `tools/launch_liveshare_e2e.py`, aliases the `obsidian` module to `plugin/src/__mocks__/obsidian.ts` and boots two lightweight plugin hosts — its own usage document scopes real-Obsidian orchestration out as "T3". A green run there proves nothing about the gate, which is why Worker 3 returned WP7 BLOCKED rather than running it. PHASE T3 builds the missing host layer. The control protocol, its command set, the `E2EPluginLike` interface (which the real `LiveSharePlugin` already satisfies), the `__LS_E2E__` bootstrap, the binding instrument seam and the `liveshare-e2e` MCP driver **already exist and are not rebuilt** — T3 is a host-launch, identity, safety and oracle layer.
- **Constraints from BUILD_SPEC (invariants — what must not change):**
  - Invariants I1–I5 (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) and I6–I10 (CONCEPT_V2 Teil 3) are binding and must not be weakened.
  - Yjs stays. No CRDT library swap, no alternative CRDT introduced anywhere.
  - `CanvasPersistence` remains the single CRDT→disk writer; it emits zero CRDT writes; `coldOpen` runs after `waitForSync` and before `start()`. **A T3 oracle reads what that writer produced; it never writes, re-serialises or normalises a `.canvas` file itself.**
  - **Zero new runtime dependencies.** Any dependency at all requires a publish date >= 7 days old (`npm view <pkg>@<version> time.created`); `npm ci` in build/deploy contexts, never `npm install`. This applies to the Python side of the rig as well — prefer the standard library, which is what the existing rig and MCP driver already do.
  - `GEOMETRY_KEYS` keeps exactly `{x, y, width, height}` and stays exported (it now describes the *file* schema). Changing membership or removing the export is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/canvas/canvas-presence.ts` is not modified by this initiative. If a WP believes it must, that is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/main.ts` may hold wiring only, never logic — it has no test file.
  - `canvas-binding.ts` / `canvas-model-bridge.ts` stay frozen and `useCanvasBinding` stays `false` until WP39/WP40 (only WP22 makes a narrow removal there).
  - Do not bump the plugin version. Do not hand-edit `plugin/main.js` or `server/dist/`. Do not read or edit `plugin/manifest.json` (broken symlink).
  - `server/` source is off limits except in WP41. Deployment, `docker/.env` and any secret are out of scope entirely.
  - **Data safety (D16, BUILD_SPEC §7 data-safety gate).** `H:\Developement\_NeuralAngels\ObsidianOrga` and `H:\Developement\_NeuralAngels\ObsidianOrga - Kopie` are the owner's **live working vaults**. No pre-existing note, canvas or attachment is ever opened for writing. Everything a run touches is a rig-created scratch artefact that teardown removes. A run that leaves either vault changed outside its own scratch artefacts is a FAILED run whatever else it proved.
  - **Never terminate what the rig did not start (D15).** No process, window or Obsidian instance the rig did not itself launch may be closed, killed or restarted. If a run would need that, it stops and says so.
  - **Long-running or interactive processes go through the `visible-console` MCP tools** (`run_python` / `run_command`, then `await_console`) — never a Bash background process. Python is launched via `run_python` with an **absolute** script path: `run_command` wraps its argument in `cmd.exe /d /c "…"`, so any nested double quote (and therefore any quoted path with spaces) breaks argument parsing. This is a workspace rule, not a preference.
  - **Settings are borrowed, not taken.** Any per-vault plugin setting the rig provisions is captured byte-exactly beforehand and restored byte-exactly on every exit path, including crash and interruption.
  - **No secret through an agent tool.** No password, token or passphrase in any command string, script argument or control-protocol message.
  - **The mock rig is never the gate (D13).** A green run of `tools/launch_liveshare_e2e.py` may not be recorded as satisfying WP7, WP40 or WP54. It aliases the `obsidian` module to `src/__mocks__/obsidian.ts` and boots two lightweight plugin hosts.
- **Technology / framework / config constraints:**
  - TypeScript + Yjs (`yjs ^13.6.0`); Obsidian's Canvas view is private and untyped — only `canvas-adapter.ts` may touch its internals.
  - Pure cores must import nothing from Obsidian, the filesystem or a clock; the precedent is `plugin/src/canvas/reconcile-plan.ts` (zero imports).
  - The control server is `node:http` bound to `127.0.0.1` — deliberately not a WebSocket, to keep the production dependency count at zero. `POST /command` takes `{cmd, args}`; `GET /events` is an SSE stream. There is no handshake and no auth: localhost plus the `__LS_E2E__` build gate is the boundary.
  - **Schema impact:** none. PHASE T3 changes no doc format and no `.canvas` file format — it is host orchestration, identity, data safety and observation only. A T3 WP that finds itself needing a format change has left its scope and must ESCALATE.
- **Entry points / relevant files (from `workflowArtifacts/RepoMap.md`, the V2 Touchpoint Inventory, and the e2e-infra survey):**
  - `plugin/src/canvas/canvas-model-bridge.ts:61–93` — the `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS` block and its "⚠ ASSUMPTION — Phase-0 real-vault spike" warning, which this WP replaces with a measurement
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md` Part IX R2 — the exact list of unverified trigger assumptions
  - `workflowArtifacts/CONCEPT_V2.md` Teil 14 §2 — the wording that makes this a release condition
  - `workflowArtifacts/canvas-v2/CaptureTriggerLedger.md` (new — the evidence artefact WP40 AC5 consults)
- **Structure references:** *(intentionally empty — no Graphify graph exists for this project; FALLBACK mode is declared in the BUILD_SPEC section 3. Worker 3 fills this in after implementation. Do not invent paths here.)*

If structure references conflict with the BUILD_SPEC or explicit task scope, the BUILD_SPEC and TaskCharter win. Escalate instead of following the map.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

*Exact copy from BUILD_SPEC section 5, PHASE T3, component C54. No paraphrasing.*

1. For every interaction in the trigger table — single move, each resize handle individually, multi-select drag, paste, text-node content edit, node add, node delete, edge add, edge delete — the run records by name which patched signal or signals fired, in which order, whether a capture followed, and the resulting verdict.
2. Each interaction's verdict is exactly one of CONFIRMED (the assumed signal fired and capture followed), CORRECTED (a different signal is the committing one, and the corrected mapping is stated) or UNCONFIRMED (no signal observed, or the gesture could not be performed), and an UNCONFIRMED entry blocks promotion.
3. The ledger records for each entry how it was produced — driven gesture or operator-performed — together with the run environment, and re-running the verification either reproduces the verdicts or the difference is itself recorded as a finding.
4. Where a corrected mapping is found, `CAPTURE_TRIGGERS` is updated to the measured set and its "inferred, not certified" warning is replaced by the measurement and its date; where an interaction fires neither patched signal, that is recorded as the explicit reason promotion cannot proceed for it.
5. The ledger is the sole evidence WP40 AC1 consults, and it is complete or it is not evidence: a partial ledger is not a weaker pass but a blocked gate.

**Definition of Done:** the trigger table is measured rather than inferred, and the P5 gate has one auditable evidence artefact.

## 5. Constraints and Known Risks

- **Permission / environment limits:** Windows dev host; run all plugin commands from `plugin/` (never the repo root). Runner is Vitest 4.0.18 — the `basic` reporter was removed, use the default or `--reporter=dot`. Budget >= 90 s for any automated `npm test` invocation (a 33.5 s sleeper makes ~41 s the floor, not a hang). No Graphify graph exists for this project (declared FALLBACK mode) — `workflowArtifacts/RepoMap.md` is the structural map. **T3 environment facts, given — do not re-derive:** Obsidian executable `C:\Users\tschm\AppData\Local\Programs\Obsidian\Obsidian.exe`; vault registry `%APPDATA%\obsidian\obsidian.json`; target vaults `H:\Developement\_NeuralAngels\ObsidianOrga` and `H:\Developement\_NeuralAngels\ObsidianOrga - Kopie` (spaces in the path are load-bearing); the built plugin is already installed in the first. The Python side of this phase has no vitest coverage and must not pretend to — its units are verified by a standalone `python tools/test_<name>.py` script per workspace convention; every TypeScript change still goes through the `plugin/` vitest gate.
- **Known flaky patterns:**
  - No timing-based echo suppression: no new `setTimeout` waits and no new timing constants. V2's echo breaker is byte equality.
  - No wall-clock sleeps in new tests (the existing 33.5 s sleeper in `wp5/latency.test.ts` is legacy, not a pattern to copy).
  - Never reason from two peers only — interleaving classes from three peers upward are distinct.
  - Do not assert on log strings as the primary oracle; state is the oracle, signatures are for humans.
  - Biome reports a whole-file `format` finding per touched file (CRLF environment artifact). Advisory locally, gating in CI — do not mass-reformat.
  - `sync.waitQuiescent` as it stands is bumped **only** by control-initiated `canvas.simulateEdit`; both host builders pass `bump = () => {}`. On a real instance it therefore reports quiescent while remote deltas are still in flight. Do not build a wait on it until WP49 fixes it.
  - `canvas.state` returns the shared-doc snapshot, not the rendered view and not the file. Doc-level convergence is not file-level convergence on a real host (D17).
  - Binding-counter SSE events currently carry `path: ""` — they are module-global, not path-scoped (WP52 fixes this). Do not attribute one to a canvas before then.
  - A real Obsidian run is slow and stateful. Retrying a flaky step without a teardown in between compounds state; re-run from a clean start instead.
  - Obsidian is single-instance: a second vault opens as another window in the same process tree, so process-level identity says nothing about which vault is which (D14).
- **External dependency risks:** No new runtime dependency is permitted. Yjs, `y-protocols`, `lib0` and `minimatch` are already present and are the only libraries available; the Python rig and the MCP driver are standard-library only today and should stay that way. If a dependency is genuinely unavoidable, its published version must be **>= 7 days old** (`npm view <pkg>@<version> time.created`) per workspace policy, and introducing it is an ESCALATE, not a judgement call. Obsidian's private Canvas API may vanish at any release — degrade, never break (I5).
- **Hard constraints:**
  - Invariants I1–I5 (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) and I6–I10 (CONCEPT_V2 Teil 3) are binding and must not be weakened.
  - Yjs stays. No CRDT library swap, no alternative CRDT introduced anywhere.
  - `CanvasPersistence` remains the single CRDT→disk writer; it emits zero CRDT writes; `coldOpen` runs after `waitForSync` and before `start()`. **A T3 oracle reads what that writer produced; it never writes, re-serialises or normalises a `.canvas` file itself.**
  - **Zero new runtime dependencies.** Any dependency at all requires a publish date >= 7 days old (`npm view <pkg>@<version> time.created`); `npm ci` in build/deploy contexts, never `npm install`. This applies to the Python side of the rig as well — prefer the standard library, which is what the existing rig and MCP driver already do.
  - `GEOMETRY_KEYS` keeps exactly `{x, y, width, height}` and stays exported (it now describes the *file* schema). Changing membership or removing the export is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/canvas/canvas-presence.ts` is not modified by this initiative. If a WP believes it must, that is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/main.ts` may hold wiring only, never logic — it has no test file.
  - `canvas-binding.ts` / `canvas-model-bridge.ts` stay frozen and `useCanvasBinding` stays `false` until WP39/WP40 (only WP22 makes a narrow removal there).
  - Do not bump the plugin version. Do not hand-edit `plugin/main.js` or `server/dist/`. Do not read or edit `plugin/manifest.json` (broken symlink).
  - `server/` source is off limits except in WP41. Deployment, `docker/.env` and any secret are out of scope entirely.
  - **Data safety (D16, BUILD_SPEC §7 data-safety gate).** `H:\Developement\_NeuralAngels\ObsidianOrga` and `H:\Developement\_NeuralAngels\ObsidianOrga - Kopie` are the owner's **live working vaults**.

  - **The mock rig is never the gate (D13).** A green run of `tools/launch_liveshare_e2e.py` may not be recorded as satisfying WP7, WP40 or WP54. It aliases the `obsidian` module to `src/__mocks__/obsidian.ts` and boots two lightweight plugin hosts.

## 6. Definition of Done Artifacts

- **Required changed files:**
  - `workflowArtifacts/canvas-v2/CaptureTriggerLedger.md` (new)
  - `plugin/src/canvas/canvas-model-bridge.ts` (only if the measurement corrects the mapping)
- **Required report:** `ImplementationReport_WP54.md` (in `workflowArtifacts/canvas-v2/`)
- **BUILD_SPEC updates required:** no — unless implementation invalidates an architecture decision, in which case ESCALATE rather than editing the spec.
- **Gate status required at handover:** `npm run build` PASS and `npm test` with 0 failures, run from `plugin/`. All visible tests PASS. For the Python side of this phase, the standalone `python tools/test_<name>.py` script for this WP passes, launched through `visible-console` `run_python` with an absolute path.
