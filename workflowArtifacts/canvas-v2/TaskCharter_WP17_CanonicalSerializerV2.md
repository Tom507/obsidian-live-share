# Task Charter — WP17: Canonical serializer V2

**Charter Status:** `SPEC_COMPLETE`
**WP:** WP17
**Phase:** P1
**task_mode:** `standard`
**Depends on:** WP3, WP9, WP10, WP13
**W4 Test Targets:** `0`

> **Metadata block** — Worker 3 Core reads only these fields to determine execution order and routing. Worker 4 checks `W4 Test Targets` before deciding whether to read section 7b. Full charter content is loaded by sub-agents in their own context windows.

---

## 1. Task Objective

- **Outcome:** the file is a deterministic projection of the doc on every client.
- **BUILD_SPEC reference:** `workflowArtifacts/canvas-v2/BUILD_SPEC_CanvasV2.md` — section 5, component **C17 — Canonical serializer V2** (work package WP17); phase **P1**.

---

## 2. Scope and Boundaries

- **In scope:**
  - Change type: modify (`buildCanvasData` `:98–130`, `serializeCanvas` `:132–137`; re-exported at `canvas-persistence.ts:388`, called at `:229`)
  - Responsibility: expand V2 registers back into the exact Obsidian file schema, sorted by `(ord, id)`, with `ord` itself never written.
  - Scope summary: `(ord,id)` sort, register expansion, `ord` not written
- **Out of scope / non-goals:**
  - Changing what Obsidian expects in the file — the output schema is fixed by Obsidian, not by us.
  - Writing `ord` into the file.
  - The tombstone *decision*; this WP consumes the suppression predicate from WP12.
- **Known interfaces / dependencies:**
  - Input: the doc's V2 record state plus the tombstone view
  - Output: the canonical `.canvas` file content
  - Depends on work packages: WP3, WP9, WP10, WP13
  - **Convergence-fuzzer link (required by the BUILD_SPEC):** WP23 byte-equality assertion (this is its primary target).

---

## 3. Architecture Context

*Task-local architecture guidance only.*

- **Component(s) being changed:** Canonical serializer V2
- **Interfaces involved:**
  - Input: the doc's V2 record state plus the tombstone view
  - Output: the canonical `.canvas` file content
- **Constraints from BUILD_SPEC (invariants — what must not change):**
  - Invariants I1–I5 (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) and I6–I10 (CONCEPT_V2 Teil 3) are binding and must not be weakened.
  - Yjs stays. No CRDT library swap, no alternative CRDT introduced anywhere.
  - `CanvasPersistence` remains the single CRDT→disk writer; it emits zero CRDT writes; `coldOpen` runs after `waitForSync` and before `start()`.
  - **Zero new runtime dependencies.** Any dependency at all requires a publish date >= 7 days old (`npm view <pkg>@<version> time.created`); `npm ci` in build/deploy contexts, never `npm install`.
  - `GEOMETRY_KEYS` keeps exactly `{x, y, width, height}` and stays exported (it now describes the *file* schema). Changing membership or removing the export is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/canvas/canvas-presence.ts` is not modified by this initiative. If a WP believes it must, that is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/main.ts` may hold wiring only, never logic — it has no test file.
  - `canvas-binding.ts` / `canvas-model-bridge.ts` stay frozen and `useCanvasBinding` stays `false` until WP39/WP40 (only WP22 makes a narrow removal there).
  - Do not bump the plugin version. Do not hand-edit `plugin/main.js` or `server/dist/`. Do not read or edit `plugin/manifest.json` (broken symlink).
  - `server/` source is off limits except in WP41. Deployment, `docker/.env` and any secret are out of scope entirely.
- **Technology / framework / config constraints:**
  - TypeScript + Yjs (`yjs ^13.6.0`); Obsidian's Canvas view is private and untyped — only `canvas-adapter.ts` may touch its internals.
  - Pure cores must import nothing from Obsidian, the filesystem or a clock; the precedent is `plugin/src/canvas/reconcile-plan.ts` (zero imports).
  - **Schema impact:** **`meta.schemaVersion = 2`.** The *doc* format changes; the `.canvas` *file* format does not. Mixed-version rule (CONCEPT_V2 Teil 12): a client whose major schema version differs from the doc's goes to Receive-and-Persist rather than guessing a translation. In P1 that degradation is local — capture disabled for the path, persistence continues — and it is unified with the room-level mode in WP32.
- **Entry points / relevant files (from `workflowArtifacts/RepoMap.md`, V2 Touchpoint Inventory):**
  - `plugin/src/files/canvas-sync.ts:98–130` — `buildCanvasData` (dangling-edge prune `:120–126`)
  - `plugin/src/files/canvas-sync.ts:132–137` — `serializeCanvas`
  - `plugin/src/files/canvas-persistence.ts:388` (re-export) and `:229` (the only call site)
- **Structure references:** *(intentionally empty — no Graphify graph exists for this project; FALLBACK mode is declared in the BUILD_SPEC section 3. Worker 3 fills this in after implementation. Do not invent paths here.)*

If structure references conflict with the BUILD_SPEC or explicit task scope, the BUILD_SPEC and TaskCharter win. Escalate instead of following the map.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

*Exact copy from BUILD_SPEC section 5, component C17. No paraphrasing.*

1. Records are emitted sorted by `(ord, id)`; `pos`/`size`/`from`/`to` are expanded into `x`/`y`/`width`/`height` and the endpoint keys exactly as Obsidian expects; `ord` does not appear in the file.
2. Records suppressed by the tombstone predicate (deleted or quarantined) are not emitted, and an edge whose endpoint record is suppressed is not emitted either.
3. Two replicas with the same doc state produce byte-identical files, including after a reorder.
4. Round-trip stability: parse(serialize(state)) yields the same records and the same relative order.

**Definition of Done:** the file is a deterministic projection of the doc on every client.

## 5. Constraints and Known Risks

- **Permission / environment limits:** Windows dev host; run all plugin commands from `plugin/` (never the repo root). Runner is Vitest 4.0.18 — the `basic` reporter was removed, use the default or `--reporter=dot`. Budget >= 90 s for any automated `npm test` invocation (a 33.5 s sleeper makes ~41 s the floor, not a hang). No Graphify graph exists for this project (declared FALLBACK mode) — `workflowArtifacts/RepoMap.md` is the structural map.
- **Known flaky patterns:**
  - No timing-based echo suppression: no new `setTimeout` waits and no new timing constants. V2's echo breaker is byte equality.
  - No wall-clock sleeps in new tests (the existing 33.5 s sleeper in `wp5/latency.test.ts` is legacy, not a pattern to copy).
  - Never reason from two peers only — interleaving classes from three peers upward are distinct.
  - Do not assert on log strings as the primary oracle; state is the oracle, signatures are for humans.
  - Biome reports a whole-file `format` finding per touched file (CRLF environment artifact). Advisory locally, gating in CI — do not mass-reformat.
- **External dependency risks:** No new runtime dependency is permitted. Yjs, `y-protocols`, `lib0` and `minimatch` are already present and are the only libraries available. Obsidian's private Canvas API may vanish at any release — degrade, never break (I5).
- **Hard constraints:**
  - Invariants I1–I5 (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) and I6–I10 (CONCEPT_V2 Teil 3) are binding and must not be weakened.
  - Yjs stays. No CRDT library swap, no alternative CRDT introduced anywhere.
  - `CanvasPersistence` remains the single CRDT→disk writer; it emits zero CRDT writes; `coldOpen` runs after `waitForSync` and before `start()`.
  - **Zero new runtime dependencies.** Any dependency at all requires a publish date >= 7 days old (`npm view <pkg>@<version> time.created`); `npm ci` in build/deploy contexts, never `npm install`.
  - `GEOMETRY_KEYS` keeps exactly `{x, y, width, height}` and stays exported (it now describes the *file* schema). Changing membership or removing the export is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/canvas/canvas-presence.ts` is not modified by this initiative. If a WP believes it must, that is an ESCALATE.
  - `plugin/src/main.ts` may hold wiring only, never logic — it has no test file.
  - `canvas-binding.ts` / `canvas-model-bridge.ts` stay frozen and `useCanvasBinding` stays `false` until WP39/WP40 (only WP22 makes a narrow removal there).
  - Do not bump the plugin version. Do not hand-edit `plugin/main.js` or `server/dist/`. Do not read or edit `plugin/manifest.json` (broken symlink).
  - `server/` source is off limits except in WP41. Deployment, `docker/.env` and any secret are out of scope entirely.

## 6. Definition of Done Artifacts

- **Required changed files:**
  - `plugin/src/files/canvas-sync.ts`
- **Required report:** `ImplementationReport_WP17.md` (in `workflowArtifacts/canvas-v2/`)
- **BUILD_SPEC updates required:** no — unless implementation invalidates an architecture decision, in which case ESCALATE rather than editing the spec.
- **Gate status required at handover:** `npm run build` PASS and `npm test` with 0 failures, run from `plugin/`. All visible tests PASS.
